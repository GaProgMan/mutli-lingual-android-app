## Project Purpose ##
  This was the first idea I had for an Android app while watching the excellent series of Android developement videos provided by Youtube user MarakanaTechTV.
  I wanted to see whether the Android app system could handle different languages/character without having to change the language and input settings and it turns out that Android can. This means a great deal to me, as I can now being coding multi-lingual apps (I am a native English speaker who can understand Japanese).
  At the minute, the source code for this app has been uploaded in the hopse of showing Android app devs just how easy it is to include localisation data in their apps. Thus, this app has not been developed any further, since it's initial commit.
  To compile this app, you will need to have access to Eclipse, an Android SDK and either an Android device emulator or actual hardware. Aside from the actual hardware, every other dependecy is available for free.
