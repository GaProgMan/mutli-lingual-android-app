Purpose of the project:		This was the first idea I had for an Android app while watching
				the excellent series of Android developement videos provided by
				Youtube user MarakanaTechTV.
							I wanted to see whether the Android app
				system could handle different languages/character without having
				to change the language and input settings and it turns out that
				Android can. This means a great deal to me, as I can now being
				coding multi-lingual apps (I am a native English speaker who
				has been studying Japanese for 5 years, at this point).
							At the minute, the source code for this
				app has been uploaded in the hopse of showing Android app devs
				just how easy it is to include localisation data in their apps.
				Thus, this app has not been developed any further, since it's
				initial commit.
							To compile this app, you will need to
				have access to Eclipse, an Android SDK and either an Android
				device emulator or actual hardware. Aside from the actual hard-
				ware, every other dependecy is available for free.
